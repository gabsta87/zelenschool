Questions

    Phone numbers : swiss format only ?
    Are we supposed to add rooms ? Is the number of participant limited according to the teacher's will ? Or by the room's choice ? Or both ?
    Courses longer than 1 hour ?
    teachers : students age. Is it some course select blocking option ? recommandation ?
    request admin action for teachers registration ?
    request email validation ? for users/teachers
    prevent with email when course is canceled ?
    Rooms have a name/address instead of number ? Admins can add/remove rooms ?
    Do you want admins to be able to change the 3 missed courses limit ?
